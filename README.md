# Creator's Wand
A free tool to help influencers in automating content management for Youtube, Instagram.

## How it started?
I'm a music student and make short videos whenever get time :), but I procrastinate while uploading videos on social media and then checking engagement on it, I'm sure other creator also face this, so let's automate this process so that we can save time

## Solutions
We need to have atleast core features to start this as a service like

1. Uploading short videos on Youtube, Instagram from single UI
2. Scheduling post for platforms
3. Get the engagement stats for videos
As I said these are core features but we can enhance it over time.

## Technology
Backend: Golang looks best as it gives performance
Frontend: Choosing ReactJS so that we can make webapp whenever we want
Database: PostgreSQL

NOTE: I have mentioned the initial features which I could think of but you can suggest more if we can make it better :)
